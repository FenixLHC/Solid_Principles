# Solid_Principles
Practical implementation of SOLID principles with C#.

SOLID principles are object-oriented design concepts relevant to software development. SOLID is an acronym for five other class-design principles: Single Responsibility Principle, Open-Closed Principle, Liskov Substitution Principle, Interface Segregation Principle, and Dependency Inversion Principle.

The Single Responsibility Principle states that:
Each software module should have one and only one reason to change.

Open/Cloced Principle states that:
Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

Liskov Substitution Principle:
Subtypes must be substitutable for their base type.

Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) states that:
Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use.

Dependency Inversion Principle states that:
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstraction
